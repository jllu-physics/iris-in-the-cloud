### 🌸 iris-in-the-cloud ☁️

**End-to-end deep learning model deployment on a budget**

This project demonstrates how to deploy a deep learning model with minimal cost and complexity:

* 🚀 FastAPI handles HTTP requests with ease and speed

* 📦 Docker enables simple, reproducible containerization

* 🧠 TensorFlow powers a compact, fully-functional DNN trained on the classic Iris dataset

* ☁️ AWS EC2 hosts the model via a lightweight, always-on instance

* 💸 Total cost: ~ $10/month

The inference endpoint is live [here](http://3.17.238.30:8000/) — have fun! 🎯

#### Reproducing Results
